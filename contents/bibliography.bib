abstract = {Nowadays, High Performance Computing (HPC) systems commonly used in bioinformatics, such as genome sequencing, incorporate multi-processor architectures. Typically, most bioinformatics applications are multi-threaded and dominated by memory-intensive operations, which are not designed to take full advantage of these HPC capabilities. Therefore, the application end-user is responsible for optimizing the application performance and improving scalability with various performance engineering concepts. Additionally, most of the HPC systems are operated in a multi-user (or multi-job) environment; thus, Quality of Service (QoS) methods are essential for balancing between application performance, scalability and system utilization. We propose a QoS workflow that optimizes the balancing ratio between parallel efficiency and system utilization. Accordingly, our proposed optimization workflow will advise the end user of a selection criteria to apply toward resources and options for a given application and HPC system architecture. For example, the BWA-MEM algorithm is a popular and modern algorithm for aligning human genome sequences. We conducted various case studies on BWA-MEM using our optimization workflow, and as a result compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, the application performance is improved up to 67{\%}, scalability extended up to 200{\%}, parallel efficiency improved up to 39{\%} and overall system utilization increased up to 38{\%}.},

abstract = {With more than a third of the genome encoding for metal-containing biomolecules, the in silico prediction of how metal ions bind to proteins is crucial in chemistry, biology, and medicine. To date, algorithms for metal-binding site prediction are mainly based on sequence analysis. Those methods have reached enough quality to predict the correct region of the protein and the coordinating residues involved in metal-binding, but they do not provide three-dimensional (3D) models. On the contrary, the prediction of accurate 3D models for protein–metal adducts by structural bioinformatics and molecular modeling techniques is still a challenge. Here, we present an update of our multipurpose molecular modeling suite, GaudiMM, to locate metal-binding sites in proteins. The approach is benchmarked on 105 X-ray structures with resolution lower than 2.0 {\AA}. Results predict the correct binding site of the metal in the biological scaffold for all the entries in the data set. Generated 3D models of the protein–metal coor...},

abstract = {GaudiMM (for Genetic Algorithms with Unrestricted Descriptors for Intuitive Molecular Modeling) is here presented as a modular platform for rapid 3D sketching of molecular systems. It combines a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm with diverse molecular descriptors to overcome the difficulty of generating candidate models for systems with scarce structural data. Its grounds consist in transforming any molecular descriptor (i.e. those generally used for analysis of data) as a guiding objective for PES explorations. The platform is written in Python with flexibility in mind: the user can choose which descriptors to use for each problem and is even encouraged to code custom ones. Illustrative cases of its potential applications are included to demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, including metal coordination of multidentate ligands, peptide folding, and protein-ligand docking.

AutoDock Vina achieves an approximately two orders of magnitude speed-up compared with the molecular docking software previously developed in our lab (AutoDock 4), while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development. Further speed-up is achieved from parallelism, by using multithreading on multicore machines. AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters the results in a way transparent to the user.},

abstract = {Advances over the past few years have begun to enable prediction and design of macromolecular structures at near-atomic accuracy. Progress has stemmed from the development of reasonably accurate and efficiently computed all-atom potential functions as well as effective conformational sampling strategies appropriate for searching a highly rugged energy landscape, both driven by feedback from structure prediction and design tests. A unified energetic and kinematic framework in the Rosetta program allows a wide range of molecular modeling problems, from fibril structure prediction to RNA folding to the design of new protein interfaces, to be readily investigated and highlights areas for improvement. The methodology enables the creation of novel molecules with useful functions and holds promise for accelerating experimental structural inference. Emerging connections to crystallographic phasing, NMR modeling, and lower-resolution approaches are described and critically assessed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by Annual Reviews.

Given the importance of protein flexibility in drug binding, MM is involved in most if not all Computational Structure-Based Drug Discovery (CSBDD) projects. This paper introduces the reader to the fundamentals of MM, with a special emphasis on how the target data used in the parametrization of force fields determine their strengths and weaknesses. Variations and recent developments such as polarizable force fields are discussed. The paper ends with a brief overview of common force fields in CSBDD.},

abstract = {ISSN: 1746-0441 (Print) 1746-045X (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/iedc20 Introduction: Biological macromolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, are (still) molecules and thus they follow the same chemical rules that any simple molecule follows, even if their size generally renders accurate studies unhelp-ful. However, in the context of drug discovery, a detailed analysis of ligand association is required for understanding or predicting their interactions and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computations are relevant tools to help elucidate this process. Areas covered: In this review, the authors explore the use of QM/MM for drug discovery. After a brief description of the molecular mechanics (MM) tech-nique, the authors describe the subtractive and additive techniques for QM/ MM computations. The authors then present several application cases in topics involved in drug discovery. Expert opinion: QM/MM have been widely employed during the last decades to study chemical processes such as enzyme--inhibitor interactions. However, despite the enthusiasm around this area, plain MM simulations may be more meaningful than QM/MM. To obtain reliable results, the authors suggest fixing several keystone parameters according to the underlying chemistry of each studied system.},

@techreport{MoralesMedina2009,
abstract = {We call molecular modeling to the application of suitable laws in the analysis of phenomena occurred at scales less than those accounted for by the macroscopic world. Such different scales (including micro-, meso-and macroscales), can be linked and integrated in order to improve understanding and predictions of complex physical chemistry phenomena, thus originating a global or multiscale analysis. A considerable amount of chemical engineering phenomena are complex due to the interrelation among these different realms of length and time. Multiscale modeling rises as an alternative for an outstanding mathematical and conceptual representation of such phenomena. This adequate representation may help to design and optimize chemical and petrochemical processes from a microscopic point of view. Herein we present a brief introduction to both molecular and multiscale modeling methods. We also comment and examine opportunities for applying the different levels of modeling to the analysis of industrial problems. The fundamental mathematical machinery of the molecular modelling theories is presented in order to motivate the study of these new engineering tools. Finally, we show a classification of different strategies for applying multilevel analysis, illustrating various examples of each methodology.},

@article{Feng2018,
abstract = {With the idea of retrosynthetic analysis, which was raised in the 1960s, chemical synthesis analysis and pathway design have been transformed from a complex problem to a regular process of structural simplification. This review aims to summarize the developments of computer-assisted synthetic analysis and design in recent years, and how machine-learning algorithms contributed to them. LHASA system started the pioneering work of designing semi-empirical reaction modes in computers, with its following rule-based and network-searching work not only expanding the databases, but also building new approaches to indicating reaction rules. Programs like ARChem Route Designer replaced hand-coded reaction modes with automatically-extracted rules, and programs like Chematica changed traditional designing into network searching. Afterward, with the help of machine learning, two-step models which combine reaction rules and statistical methods became the main stream. Recently, fully data-driven learning methods using deep neural networks which even do not require any prior knowledge, were applied into this field. Up to now, however, these methods still cannot replace experienced human organic chemists due to their relatively low accuracies. Future new algorithms with the aid of powerful computational hardware will make this topic promising and with good prospects.},

abstract = {Drug design is a creative act of the same magnitude as composing, sculpting, or writing. The results can touch the lives of millions, but the creator is rarely one scientist and the rewards are distributed differently in the arts than in the sciences. The mechanisms of creativity are the same, i.e., incremental (plodding from darkness to dawn) or sudden (the "Eureka" effect) realization, but both are poorly understood. Creativity remains a human characteristic, but it is directly related to the tools available, especially computer software and hardware. While modelling software continues to mature, very little new has evolved in terms of hardware. Here, we discuss the history of molecular modelling and describe two novel modelling tools, a haptic device and a program, SCULPT, to generate solid molecular models at atomic resolution.},
