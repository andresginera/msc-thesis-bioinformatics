=============

As we have seen, GAUDImm has potential for the design of new drugs due to its
ability of working in general systems with no previous data. We have the
motivation for **improving the program** with the ultimate goal of a reference
program for molecular modelling.

Our efforts in improvements were focused in two main aspects of the program: 

- Performanceâ€™s optimization: **PGaudi**. The development of a GAUDImm extension
  based in Python 2 for parallel execution of GAUDImm jobs.

- UX improvement: **GaudiViewX**. The creation of an updated version of the
  graphical interface GaudiView to view and analyse the GAUDImm output solutions
  with new functionalities. The extension is based in Python 3 and PyQt5.
