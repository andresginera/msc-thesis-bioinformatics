As we have seen, GaudiMM has potential for the design of new drugs due to its
ability of working in systems with no previous data, and we had the motivation
for **improving the program** with the ultimate goal a reference program for
molecular modelling.

Our efforts in improvements were focused in two main aspects of the program: 

- Performanceâ€™s optimization: **PGaudi**. The development of a GaudiMM extension for parallel execution of GaudiMM jobs.

- UX improvement: **GaudiViewX**. The creation of an updated version of GaudiView to view and analyse the GaudiMM output solutions with new functionalities.
