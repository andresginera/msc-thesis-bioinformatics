5. Results and Discussion
=========================

5.1. Parameterization of the performance optimization
=====================================================

Here it will be presented and discussed the results of execution time reduction
with PGaudi compared with Gaudi. The results will be, in principle, with a small
sample of the benchmarking of the paper:
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm061277y. The sample are 12 cases randomly
selected. We will use different values for the parameters of number of
generations and number of individuals per generation:

- 100 generations and 200 individuals.
- 160 generations and 320 individuals.
- 200 generations and 400 individuals.

    Tables and graphics

The radius of searching will be 5A. We though it is a good and fair radius.

5.2. Percentage of success in the whole benchmarking?
=====================================================


5.3. Parameterization of GA variables like mut and cross?
